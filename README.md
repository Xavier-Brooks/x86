# x86
Upon taking an embedded system class at my university I gained a new appreciation for assembly programming. As a result I sought out a means of learning another assembly language. This project is me following the lessons provided by the website asmtutor to learn x86 assembly on free time. 

Below is a link to a website that features a table of all the system calls necessary for the asmtutor tutorial in addition to more that can be explored.
